# VS Report code
R code used in generating report for VS.

Data needed for the functions to run is not included for privacy reasons.

All functions are included in the report.R file. You will find my data cleaning steps, data joing via 'dplyr' package, regression models, and random forest models.

Full report can be viewed on [my site](https://www.johnlague.com/pages/verticalsolutions).
